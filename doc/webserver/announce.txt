ChangeLog for Privoxy
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Version 3.0.23 stable ***

- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed a DoS issue in case of client requests with incorrect
    chunk-encoded body. When compiled with assertions enabled
    (the default) they could previously cause Privoxy to abort().
    Reported by Matthew Daley.
  - Fixed multiple segmentation faults and memory leaks in the
    pcrs code. This fix also increases the chances that an invalid
    pcrs command is rejected as such. Previously some invalid commands
    would be loaded without error. Note that Privoxy's pcrs sources
    (action and filter files) are considered trustworthy input and
    should not be writable by untrusted third-parties.
  - Fixed an 'invalid read' bug which could at least theoretically
    cause Privoxy to crash. So far, no crashes have been observed.
  - Compiles with --disable-force again. Reported by Kay Raven.
  - Client requests with body that can't be delivered no longer
    cause pipelined requests behind them to be rejected as invalid.
    Reported by Basil Hussain.

- General improvements:
  - If a pcrs command is rejected as invalid, Privoxy now logs
    the cause of the problem as text. Previously the pcrs error
    code was logged.
  - The tests are less likely to cause false positives.

- Action file improvements:
  - '.sify.com/' is no longer blocked. Apparently it is not actually
    a pure tracking site (anymore?). Reported by Andrew on ijbswa-users@.
  - Unblock banners on .amnesty.de/ which aren't ads.

- Documentation improvements:
  - The 'Would you like to donate?' section now also contains
    a "Paypal" address.
  - The list of supported operating systems has been updated.
  - The existence of the SF support and feature trackers has been
    deemphasized because they have been broken for months.
    Most of the time the mailing lists still work.
  - The claim that default.action updates are sometimes released
    on their own has been removed. It hasn't happened in years.
  - Explicitly mention that Tor's port may deviate from the default
    when using a bundle. Requested by Andrew on ijbswa-users@.

About Privoxy:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for
enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling
access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a
flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and
tastes. It has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user
networks.

Privoxy is Free Software and licensed under the GNU GPLv2.

Our TODO list is rather long. Helping hands and donations are welcome:

  * http://www.privoxy.org/faq/general.html#PARTICIPATE

  * http://www.privoxy.org/faq/general.html#DONATE

At present, Privoxy is known to run on Windows 95 and later versions
(98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7 etc.), GNU/Linux (RedHat, SuSE,
Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Slackware and others), Mac OS X (10.4 and
upwards on PPC and Intel processors), OS/2, Haiku, DragonFly,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and various other flavors of Unix.

In addition to the core features of ad blocking and cookie management,
Privoxy provides many supplemental features, that give the end-user
more control, more privacy and more freedom:

  *  Supports "Connection: keep-alive". Outgoing connections can be kept
     alive independently from the client. Currently not available on all
     platforms.

  *  Supports IPv6, provided the operating system does so too,
     and the configure script detects it.

  *  Supports tagging which allows to change the behaviour based on client
     and server headers.

  *  Can be run as an "intercepting" proxy, which obviates the need to
     configure browsers individually.

  *  Sophisticated actions and filters for manipulating both server and
     client headers.

  *  Can be chained with other proxies.

  *  Integrated browser based configuration and control utility at
     http://config.privoxy.org/ (shortcut: http://p.p/). Browser-based
     tracing of rule and filter effects. Remote toggling.

  *  Web page filtering (text replacements, removes banners based on size,
     invisible <quote>web-bugs</quote> and HTML annoyances, etc.)

  *  Modularized configuration that allows for standard settings and user
     settings to reside in separate files, so that installing updated actions
     files won't overwrite individual user settings.

  *  Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions in the configuration
     files, and a more sophisticated and flexible configuration syntax.

  *  GIF de-animation.

  *  Bypass many click-tracking scripts (avoids script redirection).

  *  User-customizable HTML templates for most proxy-generated pages (e.g.
     "blocked" page).

  *  Auto-detection and re-reading of config file changes.
    
  *  Most features are controllable on a per-site or per-location basis.
